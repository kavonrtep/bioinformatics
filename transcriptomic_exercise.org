#+TITLE: Analysis gene expression in Galaxy environment

* Galaxy server:


* RNA-Seq Data
The sequencing data you will be working with is from /Drosophila melanogaster/.
The experiment has two conditioins, WT (wildtype) and KO (knockout), and three
samples in each condition. The sequencing data is paired-end, so there are two
files for each of the samples. Your aim will be to find differentially expressed
genes in WT vs KO.

RNA-Seq data are located in =~/Desktop/bioinformatics/data/rna-seq-drosophila=

* Upload data to Galaxy

Before upload, you will need to create new account on https://usegalaxy.eu/.
Upload all 13 files included in the dataset  to  server. For fastq files select
fastqsanger format before upload.



** Files description:

Gene annotation file:
=ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf=

6 files containing paired-ended reads for the KO samples:

#+begin_example
KO_01_R1.fastq
KO_01_R2.fastq
KO_02_R1.fastq
KO_02_R2.fastq
KO_03_R1.fastq
KO_03_R2.fastq
#+end_example

files containing paired-ended reads for the WT samples:

#+begin_example
WT_01_R1.fastq
WT_01_R2.fastq
WT_02_R1.fastq
WT_02_R2.fastq
WT_03_R1.fastq
WT_03_R2.fastq
#+end_example
Each condition has three samples, and each sample has two files (an R1 file
containing forward reads and an R2 file containing reverse reads).

Click on the eye icon to the top right of any FASTQ file to view the first part
of the file.

Note: Since the reads in this dataset are synthetic, they do not have real
quality scores.

Note: The reads are paired-end, i.e. WT_01_R1.fastq and WT_01_R2.fastq are
paired reads from one sequencing run. If you're unfamiliar with paired-end
sequencing, you can read about it here.


* Mapping reads with RNA-Star
We will map RNA-Seq reads into genome od D.melanogaster using RNA-STAR program. For alignment use following
parameters:


- Single-end or paired-end reads:	paired	
- Reference genome : D. melanogaster, Dm3
- Gene model (gff3,gtf) file for splice junctions	1: ensembl_dm3.chr4.gtf (from upload)
Other parameters can be set to dafaults:

To align all data at once, use batch mode:

[[./fig/rna_star_alignment.png]]

Output of RNA-STAR are alingments in BAM format. Click on eye icon and inspect
BAM file. Mapping can be also viewed from USCS genome or using IGV browser. 

* convert bam files to feature count
 
We will count individual reads mapped to gened using tool =featureCounts=. 
[[./fig/featureCount.png]]

* Test for differential expression with DESeq2 tool
Set test according to screenshot below, also, set Output normalized counts table
to =yes=

[[./fig/deseq2.png]]

tree new datasets will be created, table with normalized expression values,
graphical summary and table with statistics. 

Use IGV browser to visualize read alignment and find genes which exhibit
statistically significant differential expression 
Bam files can be loaded directly from Galaxy interface
