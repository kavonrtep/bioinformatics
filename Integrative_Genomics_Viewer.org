* E.coli data
Data for E.coli genome NC_000913.3 Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655, complete genome can be found in =bioinformatics/data/igv_data_e_coli=

For BAM file, you will need to create index file using command:

#+begin_src bash
samtools index dna_sequencing.bam
#+end_src

- Start IGV
- load Genome from file.
- import individual tracks from files 
  
* Types of files included:

** BAM/SAM
A BAM file (.bam) is the binary version of a SAM file.  A SAM file (.sam) is a tab-delimited text file that contains *sequence alignment data*.   These formats are described on the SAM Tools web site: http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/.

This file can be inspected using
#+begin_src bash
samtools view dna_sequencing.bam | less -S
#+end_src
** BED

A BED file (.bed) is a tab-delimited text file that defines a feature track. It can have any file extension, but .bed is recommended. The BED file format is described on the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web site: http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat. Tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) can be downloaded to BED files and loaded into IGV.

simplest form example:
#+begin_src tsv
chr11	5246919	5246920
chr11	5255660	5255661
chr11	5247945	5247946
#+end_src

** GFF3

A General Feature Format (GFF) file is a simple tab-delimited text file for describing genomic features. This format can be used to describe and visualize gene structure:

[[fig/gff_gene.png]]

** BigWig
The bigWig format is for display of dense, continuous data that will be displayed as a graph:
[[fig/bigwig.png]]

** VCF 
 Variant Call Format, and it is used  encode structural genetic variants. Variant calls include SNPs, indels, and genomic rearrangements.

#+begin_comment
- update bioinformatics repository
- load E.coli genome from directory ~/Desktop/bioinformatics_git/data/igv_data_e_coli
- load all tracks:
- show coverage after zoom
- colors of genomic reads (grey long inser or single, green shorter insert)
- variants - show coloring
- coverage plot - multiple show group autoscale
